# Blogging Best Practices

## Basic Concepts
- [**Medium**](https://medium.com/): An online blogging platform
- **Publication**: A way to organize blog posts by community or organization on Medium.  Publications have authors and editors.
    - _Authors_ create content and submit it to an editor. 
    - _Editors_ edit the articles and approve them for inclusion in the publication

## Getting Started
1. Create an account on Medium.
2. Complete your profile. It should include your name, a photo of you, and a brief bio. Try and strike a balance between casual and professional.
3. Send Peter a message so he can add you to the [CDS publication](https://medium.com/rti-cds).

## The Publishing Process
1. Discuss your idea for a blog post with your colleagues. They may have thoughts, opinions, or existing expertise in whatever you're thinking about.
2. Write a blog post. 
3. Have a peer or subject matter expert review your blog post. Incorporate any feedback. 
4. Submit your blog post content and name of peer reviewer to a CDS Manager. They will review your blog post. Incoroporate any feedback.
5. Publish your blog post on Medium under the CDS publication.

## Things to watch out for
- NEVER publish confidential or sensitive project material
- If using specific client names, confirm that their names can be used in RTI materials
- If you're sharing code developed for a project, be sure the license and client contract permits it. Generalize or apply your code to an analogous example problem if necessary.
- While not all of our work is controversial, some topics may be more politicized than others.  To the extent possible, please use a non-partisan tone and use discretion when presenting arguments or opinions about issues outside our Center's area of expertise.
